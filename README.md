## Torch Plugin

# Lightning Manager

With this plugin is possible to change some lightning properties like damage and interval between lightnings (random, player and grid).

After you start Torch, a configuration file is created inside the Instance folder, `LightningManager.cfg`. After you change the file you need to restart Torch.

You can change the properties directly inside the file, no gui is provided at the moment.

## Armor blocks directly hit by lightning take damage
This plugin also fix a 'bug' where Armor Blocks are instantly destroyed by a lightning if hit directly, armor blocks will take damage and be deformed like any other block based on their integrity and deformation ratio.
